Dojo Pong

Players are allowed to create an account and have text message verifications upon registration.  
After, players can challenge, accept, or deny a ping pong match.  Each win/loss is recorded in the usersâ€™ history as well as their ranking.  There is also a discussion board where users can talk to one another.
